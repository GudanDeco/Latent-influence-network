# Latent Influence Network (LIN) and LIDET Framework

This repository contains the implementation of the **Latent Influence Network (LIN)** and the **Latent Influence Detection Framework (LIDET)**, introduced in our ICWSM 2025 paper.

## 📘 Paper Title
**LIN: Latent Influence Network for Discovering Hidden Directed Influence Links on Social Media**  

## 🔍 Overview

This project proposes a novel method for uncovering latent influence in social networks:

- **LIN (Latent Influence Network)**: A network structure inferred from social activity patterns to represent hidden influence links.
- **LIDET (Latent Influence Detection Framework)**: A systematic evaluation and optimization framework for influence modeling, using user behavior prediction tasks.

## 📊 Datasets

Due to Twitter's data sharing policies, only sample data are included in `Data_example/`. You may need to rehydrate them using tools like `twarc`.

## 📓 Notebooks

All core implementation examples, evaluations, and visualizations are provided in the `ipynb/` directory. These include:
- Influence network construction
- Parameter selection for LIDET
- Classification evaluation

Currently, the notebooks cover preprocessing and modeling for the Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets. Additional notebooks (e.g., for COVID-19 ) are still being organized and will be added soon.

## 📈 Key Features

- Automatically identifies hidden influence structures.
- Achieves **99% classification accuracy** on COVID-19 Twitter data.
- Generalizes across multiple real-world datasets.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

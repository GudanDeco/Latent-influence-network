# Latent Influence Network (LIN) and LIDET Framework

This repository contains the implementation of the **Latent Influence Network (LIN)** and the **Latent Influence Detection Framework (LIDET)**, introduced in our ICWSM 2025 paper.

## 📘 Paper Title
**LIN: Latent Influence Network for Discovering Hidden Directed Influence Links on Social Media**  

## 🔍 Overview

This project proposes a novel method for uncovering latent influence in social networks:

- **LIN (Latent Influence Network)**: A network structure inferred from social activity patterns to represent hidden influence links.
- **LIDET (Latent Influence Detection Framework)**: A systematic evaluation and optimization framework for influence modeling, using user behavior prediction tasks.
